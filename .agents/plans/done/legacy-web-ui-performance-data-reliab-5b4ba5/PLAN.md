# Summary
Implemented a system-wide non-blocking yield mechanism to resolve 20-30s Web UI lags and fixed critical data population bugs in the Web Handlers. Also transitioned the font system to a human-readable ASCII-art source format.

## Key Decisions
- **Non-Blocking Yield Mechanism**: Introduced `yieldCallback` in all data clients (`NationalRail`, `TfL`, `Weather`, `RSS`). This allows `webServer.handleClient()` to be called during long-duration network I/O, keeping the Web interface responsive.
- **Display Manager Integration**: Centralized the yield entry point in `DisplayManager::yieldAnimationUpdate` to allow concurrent animation updates and web request handling.
- **Web Data Standardisation**: Normalized JSON keys between the legacy flat UI and modern multi-board backend (e.g. mapping `station` vs `crs`).
- **Coordinate Protection**: Implemented a "lazy update" for coordinates in `WebHandlers` to prevent zeroing out lat/lon when the browser fails to provide them during a save.
- **Font Source Format**: Moved the "Source of Truth" for fonts to human-readable `.txt` files in `modules/displayManager/fonts/source/`. This enables easier font editing and automatic BDF/binary generation.
