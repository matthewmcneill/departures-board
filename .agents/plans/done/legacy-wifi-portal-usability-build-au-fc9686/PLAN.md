# Summary
Resolved critical WiFi portal usability issues and race conditions. Improved UI alignment and pre-selection logic for the configured network. Integrated portal UI assets into the automated PlatformIO build pipeline to ensure frontend changes are reliably reflected in firmware.

## Key Decisions
- **Asynchronous Initialization**: Refactored the portal's `init()` function to `await` configuration data before rendering. This eliminates the race condition where empty scan results would overwrite the pre-selected configured SSID.
- **Configured Network Priority**: Implemented logic to always place the currently configured SSID at the top of the list, labeled with a lightning bolt (⚡) and "(Configured)", providing instant feedback in Access Point mode.
- **UI Alignment & Stability**: Fixed misalignment of the 'Scan' button and password 'eye' icon. Stabilized button widths to prevent layout shifts during active scanning.
- **Automated Asset Synchronization**: Integrated `portalBuilder.py` as a pre-build script in `platformio.ini`. This automates the minification and embedding of `/portal/index.html` into the C++ header file, preventing manual synchronization errors.
- **House Style Audit**: Updated headers for `portal/index.html` and the generated `portalAssets.h` to include full "Exported Functions/Classes" lists, satisfying project documentation standards.
