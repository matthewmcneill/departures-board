# Summary
Conducted a comprehensive audit of all project source files to ensure strict adherence to the defined house style and architectural standards. This included a major migration of project headers from `.h` to `.hpp` and the addition of exhaustive Doxygen documentation across the codebase.

## Key Decisions
- **Uhpp Migration**: Enforced the `.hpp` extension for all internal project headers to visually distinguish them from external C libraries and strictly follow the project's naming conventions (`camelCase.hpp`).
- **Header Orchestration**: Centralized module definitions and exported function lists in file headers to improve discovery and maintenance for future agents.
- **Global Variable Documentation**: Enforced same-line commenting for every global instance (e.g., `ota`, `timeManager`, `appContext`) to clarify singleton roles and initialization order.
- **Build Integrity Verification**: Prioritized a full re-build (`pio run`) after the rename to ensure that all internal and nested include paths were correctly updated and resolved.
