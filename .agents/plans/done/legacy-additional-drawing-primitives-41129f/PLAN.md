# Summary
Added a suite of common drawing primitives (`drawBox`, `drawLine`, `drawCircle`, `drawRoundedBox`, `drawTriangle`) to the `drawingPrimitives` helper library to simplify board-specific UI development.

## Key Decisions
- **API Harmonization**: Implemented a unified `isFilled` parameter across all applicable primitives, abstracting away the disjointed `u8g2` naming convention (`drawBox` vs `drawFrame`).
- **Triangle Extension**: Added custom line-drawing logic to `drawTriangle` to enable unfilled triangles, a feature missing from the base `u8g2` library.
- **Helper Utility Justification**: Validated the continued use of the `drawingPrimitives` library as a high-level UI abstraction layer for text centering, truncation, and screen-aware geometry.
