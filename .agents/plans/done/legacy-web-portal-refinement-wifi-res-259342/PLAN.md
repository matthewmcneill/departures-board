# Summary
Implemented the "WiFi Reset" feature to allow users to erase credentials and reboot the board from the UI. Addressed critical connectivity issues, including a password mask mismatch and redundant WiFi reconnection logic. Performed a major House Style refactor to standardize library naming and documentation.

## Key Decisions
- **WiFi Reset Logic**: Implemented `handleWiFiReset` in `webHandlerManager` to call `wifiManager.resetSettings()`, respond to the client, and then trigger `ESP.restart()` after a delay, ensuring the user receives feedback before the board drops the link.
- **Connection Test Optimization**: Modified `testConnection` to skip `WiFi.begin()` if the requested credentials match the current active connection. This prevents the browser session from dropping during a redundant test, providing a seamless user experience.
- **House Style Library Renames**: Renamed `WiFiConfig`, `Logger`, and `HTTPUpdateGitHub` libraries to `camelCase` (`wiFiConfig`, `logger`, `hTTPUpdateGitHub`) to align with project standards.
- **LDF Discovery Fix**: Added `library.json` files to several `modules` to help PlatformIO's Library Dependency Finder correctly resolve nested dependencies between shared logic and system management.
