## 2026-03-14 - Weather & Config v2.1 Refactor

### Session Summary
Finalized the weather system refactor and configuration migration to Version 2.1. This included moving to an injectable, multi-location weather architecture and standardizing the configuration schema.

### Key Decisions
- **Injectable Weather**: Decided to have each `iDisplayBoard` own its own `WeatherStatus` object. This allows per-board weather tracking and refresh cycles.
- **Config v2.1**: Renamed `mode` to `type` and `boardMode` to `boardType` for better semantic clarity.
- **Automatic Migration**: Implemented logic in `ConfigManager` to detect v1.0/v2.0 configs and automatically upgrade/save them as v2.1 on first load.
- **Stateless Weather Client**: Refactored `weatherClient` to remove all internal state and simply update a provided `WeatherStatus` reference.
- **Icon Strategy**: Favored XBM bitmaps over Unicode fonts for weather icons due to significant Flash savings on the ESP32.
